ShadowCam User Guide (Quick Start)

Prerequisites
1. Rooted Android device (Magisk/KernelSU/APatch).
2. Grant root permission to ShadowCam when asked.
3. Install the required hook/module on your device (if your setup uses one).

Getting Started (Recommended Order)
1. Apps tab: pick your Target App.
   - Optional: enable Private Dir if you want app-specific sync paths.
2. Sources tab: select a Video or Image source.
   - Use the Preview card to confirm the result and Fit/Fill mode.
3. Sources tab: tap Sync to Camera (required after changing source).
4. Home tab: tap Arm VCAM to keep the service active.
5. Open your target app and test the camera view.

Common Problems
- Root not available:
  - Open your root manager and allow ShadowCam, then restart ShadowCam.
- No virtual feed in target app:
  - Re-sync the source and confirm the target app is selected (if using Private Dir).
  - Some apps use Camera2; your module/hook must support your target app/device.
- Not showing in LSPosed:
  - This is normal. ShadowCam is an app, not an LSPosed/Xposed module.
  - LSPosed will only show the camera hook module (for example VCAMPro) in its Modules list.
  - Make sure your module is installed, enabled, and scoped to the target app in LSPosed, then reboot.
- Need logs:
  - Logs tab: Export to Downloads (shadowcam_debug.log).

Safety Notes
- Using virtual camera features in third-party apps may violate their rules.
- Keep logs private; they can include device and session metadata.
